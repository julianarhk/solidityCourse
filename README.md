# **This is a Solidity Tutorial.**

This course is organized in pieces of code explaining the vast possibilities within the Solidity language. 

We are going to explore the basics of Solidity, such as how to start writing a Smart Contract, create basic and complex functions as well as compiling and deploying steps.

There is an explanation of the code in every file and you must read it for better comprehension of the material.

Please, test this code in your own editor and comment if there's any suggestion or improvement you'd like to point out. 

Hope you enjoy learning Solidity as much as I am.
